# WhatsApp Pseudo Bot
Simple python3 class that lets you send messages through browser automation (Selenium).
## Getting Started
To use this class you must have Selenium:

    pip install -U selenium
You also need to have the browsers driver (Chrome by default). You can change the default driver in the class initializer. You can get the Chrome driver [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).
Finally, you can find the class in `wp_bot.py`.
